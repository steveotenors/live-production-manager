# Storage Functionality Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Supabase storage functionality in the Live Production Manager app.

## Database Level Improvements

### New Storage Policy

The main issue with the storage system was an infinite recursion in the storage policy. This has been fixed with a new, simpler policy that:

1. Uses direct EXISTS queries instead of recursive functions
2. Uses the `position()` function to check for project ID in file paths
3. Follows a consistent file path convention: `project-{id}/filename.extension`

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can access their project files" ON storage.objects
FOR ALL USING (
  -- Authenticated users only
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  AND
  -- Check if the path contains a project ID the user is a member of
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM project_members 
    WHERE 
      project_members.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND 
      -- Check if the file path contains the project id
      position('project-' || project_members.project_id::text in objects.name) > 0
  )
);
```

## Application Level Improvements

### 1. Consistent Delays Between API Calls

- Added a constant `API_CALL_DELAY` (200ms) to prevent rate limiting
- Applied this delay before each storage API call
- Implemented using a Promise-based delay function

### 2. Centralized Error Handling

- Created a `handleStorageError` function that:
  - Logs detailed error information
  - Displays appropriate toast notifications to users
  - Handles specific error types (recursion errors, rate limits)
  - Returns consistent error messages

### 3. Improved Function Robustness

The following functions were enhanced:

#### A. `listFiles`
- Added delay before API call
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- Returns empty arrays instead of throwing errors

#### B. `getFileUrl`
- Added delay before API call
- Improved error handling with specific error messages

#### C. `deleteFile`
- Added delays between operations
- Enhanced error handling for folder deletion
- Added delays between batch operations

#### D. `createFolder`
- Added delay before API call
- Improved error handling

#### E. `moveFile` and `copyFile`
- Added delays before download, upload, and delete operations
- Enhanced error handling for each step
- Properly handles target filename conflicts

#### F. `renameFile`
- Added delays between operations
- Improved error handling for both files and folders
- Handles errors during multi-step folder rename process

#### G. `batchProcessFiles`
- Uses the consistent API_CALL_DELAY between operations

#### H. `searchFiles`
- Added delays before directory listing
- Improved error handling during recursive search

## Best Practices for Storage Usage

1. **File Structure**: Always follow the pattern `project-{projectId}/filename.extension`
2. **Permissions**: Files will be accessible only to members of the associated project
3. **Rate Limiting**: The application now automatically handles delays between API calls
4. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages are displayed for storage access issues

## Testing the Improvements

To verify the storage improvements are working:

1. Create a new project in the app
2. Upload files to the project storage using the standard pattern
3. Add a project member
4. Verify the project member can access the files
5. Verify non-members cannot access the files
6. Check that no infinite recursion errors appear in the console

These improvements should resolve the storage access issues while providing a better user experience when storage-related errors occur.
